🚀 Simple Chat App from Scratch
I’ve built a basic chat application using Python sockets and SQLite3 as the database.

What makes this project interesting is that I’ve implemented my own communication protocol between the client and the server — without using a REST API or HTTP. This allowed me to better understand how low-level data exchange works over TCP and how protocols can be designed from scratch.

Great experience diving into:

Socket programming 🧠

Custom protocols ✉️

Threading and concurrency ⚙️

Lightweight database handling 🗄️

It’s still a work in progress, but I’m happy with how it’s shaping up.

🔧 Always building. Always learning.
